This projects aims at making a graphics overlay for a football video stream on OBS. 

The main components are the app.py which is the backend server.
The scoreboard.html which is the frontend for the OBS.
The control_interface.html which is the browser based controller for the whole system which is used by the operator.
The setup.html allows the operator to access a range of settings to configure the teams.

Between sessions data is saved on csv's and a json, there's no particular reason for this separation and it can be changed in the future if it is seen as the best solution.
